271. Encode and Decode Strings
---

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement encode and decode

Example 1:

Input: ["neet","code","love","you"]

Output:["neet","code","love","you"]
Example 2:

Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]

Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]
Constraints:

0 <= strs.length < 100
0 <= strs[i].length < 200
strs[i] contains only UTF-8 characters.

        encoded = ""
        for s in strs:
            encoded += str(len(s)) + "#" + s
        return encoded

    def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        decoded = []
        i = 0
        while i < len(s):
            j = i
            while s[j] != "#" and s[j].isdigit():
                j+=1
            length = int(s[i:j])
            decoded.append(s[j+1:j+1+length])
            i = j+1+length
        return decoded
