286. Walls and Gates

You are given a m√ón 2D grid initialized with these three possible values:

-1 - A water cell that can not be traversed.
0 - A treasure chest.
INF - A land cell that can be traversed. We use the integer 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF.
Fill each land cell with the distance to its nearest treasure chest. If a land cell cannot reach a treasure chest than the value should remain INF.

Assume the grid can only be traversed up, down, left, or right.

Example 1:

Input: [
  [2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],
  [2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],
  [2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],
  [0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]
]

Output: [
  [3,-1,0,1],
  [2,2,1,-1],
  [1,-1,2,-1],
  [0,-1,3,4]
]
Example 2:

Input: [
  [0,-1],
  [2147483647,2147483647]
]

Output: [
  [0,-1],
  [1,2]
]
Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
grid[i][j] is one of {-1, 0, 2147483647}

#    - Mark these cells as visited.

# 2. Start BFS with distance = 0. Increment distance after processing each level.
